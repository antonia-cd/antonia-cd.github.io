                        <br>In the cover for my Zine, “The Art of Feeling Small”, I wanted to encapsulate the both abstract and very human sensation of feeling small. I did this by recreating a forest night sky, but with non realistic, geometric shapes and hand-drawn texture. I hoped to draw people in to the image, and get just a taste of the emotion the rest of the zine was aimed at invoking.

                    <p> 2023<br>These select spreads from my Zine, “The Art of Feeling Small”, show my desire to integrate the design with the actual content of the text. With more hand drawn, natural scenes, I used the depth in these scenes to mimic the depth of the point the writing was trying to make. Also, I gave the paragraphs more fluid outlines, which was also done to imitate the movement of nature. All images and textures were drawn originally on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p> 2023 <br> In my icon, I wanted to include the contrasting modern and organic elements that Helfand uses in her work, as well as making a reference to Design Observer. I included layers of half circles for an abstract, modern feel, although I kept it hand-drawn to maintain a look of authenticity. Also, I included a web/cell-like series of lines at the bottom half of the circle to mirror some of the organic designs Helfand has produced. I also liked this inclusion in my work because the web can represent connection and dialogue, both things that Helfand values and fosters. Lastly, the icon itself is a circle broken in half; the circle and the line going through it create the letters O and D, the initials for Design Observer.</p>
